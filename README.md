**FEATURES:**

* Users can store and then play a puzzle they've found elsewhere. Puzzles are entered row-by-row, with a '0' representing a blank space. Alternatively, users can play a randomly generated puzzle.

* During a game, users can fill a cell, ask for a hint, or have the computer finish the puzzle. Cells are chosen by typing the row and column number.

* At the end of the game, the time-to-complete and the number of hints and guesses are displayed.
